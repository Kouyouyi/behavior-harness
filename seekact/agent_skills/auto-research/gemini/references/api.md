# Gemini MCP API

## Request and response

Use `ctx.call("gemini_generate", **request)` inside Python, or the same arguments
with the interactive MCP tool. This is the supported subset of OpenRouter's
`POST /api/v1/chat/completions`, not a Google SDK wrapper. No SDK installation,
API key or network access is needed in your workspace.

| Field | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `messages` | Required, 1–64 messages; roles `system`, `user`, `assistant`, `tool`. |
| `max_tokens` | Output budget, 1–16384; default 2048. Reasoning also consumes tokens. |
| `temperature` | Optional number, 0–2. |
| `response_format` | `{"type":"text"}`, `{"type":"json_object"}`, or `json_schema` below. |
| `tools` | Up to 64 client function declarations; optional `description`, `parameters` JSON Schema and boolean `strict`. Names must be unique, 1–64 letters/digits/underscores/hyphens. |
| `tool_choice` | `auto`, `none`, `required`, or `{"type":"function","function":{"name":"add"}}`. A named choice must refer to a declared function; `auto`/`required` need nonempty `tools`. |
| `reasoning` | Optional OpenRouter object: `effort` **or** `max_tokens`, plus optional booleans `enabled`/`exclude`. `effort="low"` and `"minimal"` are known to work. Other settings depend on provider support. A reasoning token budget must fit within request `max_tokens`. |

The model `google/gemini-3.8-flash`, endpoint, non-streaming behavior
and `provider.require_parameters=true` are fixed. Unsupported parameters fail instead of
being silently dropped. No model/provider override, plugins, server tools, web
search, remote files or arbitrary HTTP fields are accepted. `parallel_tool_calls`
is not available: current endpoints reject it.
Multiple function calls can still appear in one response; process every call.

Unpack the MCP text block once:

```python
import json

def generate(ctx, **request):
    reply = ctx.call("gemini_generate", **request)
    result = json.loads(reply["content"][0]["text"])
    print("Gemini usage:", result["usage"], "budget:", result["budget"])
    return result
```

Result fields are `model`, `message`, `finish_reason`, `usage`, `cost_usd`, and
`budget`. `message` is the complete provider assistant message: text/null content,
optional `tool_calls`, refusal and reasoning metadata. `usage` retains provider
token/cost details. `cost_usd` is null if the provider omitted it. The budget
includes call counts, charged tokens, unresolved reservations and remaining dollars.
Call and token counts are not limited.
Each generation, including a tool-result follow-up, consumes another API call.

### Spending limit

Gemini spending is capped at **$10 in total** for the session, shared by your direct
calls and Python scripts. Scripts cannot change it. Your own model usage is separate.

`budget` and `status.api_budget` include:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `session_cost_limit_usd` | Fixed total limit, 10. |
| `session_cost_reported_usd` | Cumulative confirmed provider cost. |
| `session_cost_reserved_usd` | Pending or unresolved conservative cost reservations. |
| `session_cost_remaining_usd` | Amount available for another reservation. |
| `session_cost_blocked` | Fail-closed billing state; no further Gemini calls accepted. |

A maximum cost is reserved **before** each request is sent, with fixed
provider price ceilings and no provider fallbacks. Valid reported cost
releases the unused reservation. Missing/invalid cost or a timeout keeps the
reservation; it is not treated as free usage. Exhaustion rejects Gemini calls,
not otherwise-available robot control or local Python.

A large request can be rejected even with a positive remaining balance. Reduce
`max_tokens`, trim completed history or resize images so the conservative
reservation fits. Per-request size and output-token limits still apply.

An MCP/provider failure raises `RuntimeError` through `ctx.call`; failed billable
requests retain conservative token/dollar reservations if usage cannot be confirmed.
There is no automatic retry. Inspect the trace/budget before deciding to retry.
For text/JSON consumption, check `finish_reason == "stop"`, nonempty content and
no refusal. A `length` result is incomplete; do not execute partial decisions.

## Structured output

`json_object` requests JSON syntax; specify the desired object in your prompt.
Use `json_schema` to specify field shapes. This example can be combined with image
blocks from the skill's visual prompt:

```python
schema = {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "label": {"type": "string"},
        "visible": {"type": "boolean"},
    },
    "required": ["label", "visible"],
    "additionalProperties": False,
}
result = generate(ctx,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Report label='<object name>' and visible=true."}],
    response_format={"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {
        "name": "object_detection", "strict": True, "schema": schema,
    }},
    max_tokens=1024,
)
assert result["finish_reason"] == "stop" and not result["message"].get("refusal")
detection = json.loads(result["message"]["content"])
assert set(detection) == {"label", "visible"}
assert isinstance(detection["label"], str) and type(detection["visible"]) is bool
```

The provider applies the schema; the tool does not validate generated answers
against it. Validate types, ranges, coordinate frames and task meaning in your
script before using a response for motion. Valid JSON is not accurate perception.
For positions, state the camera, units and coordinate frame in both prompt and
field descriptions; do not confuse image pixels with robot coordinates.

Each response/function parameter schema is limited to 16 KiB. Local `$ref`
references such as `#/$defs/Point` are allowed; external references are rejected.
Schema dialect support is provider-dependent, including strict tool schemas.

## Client function calling

Functions are your script's interface to Gemini, not additional MCP tools. Gemini
requests a function by name and JSON-string arguments; your code decides whether
and how to run it. The following complete two-generation example uses only local
arithmetic. Substitute tested perception or motion functions as appropriate:

```python
tools = [{"type": "function", "function": {
    "name": "add",
    "description": "Add two integers locally.",
    "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {"a": {"type": "integer"}, "b": {"type": "integer"}},
        "required": ["a", "b"],
        "additionalProperties": False,
    },
}}]
messages = [{"role": "user", "content": "Use add to compute 2+3, then report the result."}]
first = generate(ctx, messages=messages, tools=tools, tool_choice="required",
                 reasoning={"effort": "low"}, max_tokens=1024)
assert first["finish_reason"] == "tool_calls" and first["message"].get("tool_calls")
messages.append(first["message"])  # Preserve ALL fields/signatures unchanged.
for call in first["message"]["tool_calls"]:
    assert call["type"] == "function" and call["function"]["name"] == "add"
    args = json.loads(call["function"]["arguments"])
    assert set(args) == {"a", "b"} and all(type(v) is int for v in args.values())
    value = {"answer": args["a"] + args["b"]}
    messages.append({"role": "tool", "tool_call_id": call["id"],
                     "content": json.dumps(value)})
final = generate(ctx, messages=messages, tools=tools, tool_choice="none", max_tokens=1024)
assert final["finish_reason"] == "stop" and not final["message"].get("refusal")
print(final["message"]["content"])
```

Use `auto` for model-selected text/function replies, `required` to request at least
one function, or a named choice to select a specific function. Use `none` for the
final answer; that follow-up can also set `response_format` for structured JSON.
Repeat generations for a longer closed loop with an explicit iteration/budget
bound. Always append every tool result with its matching `tool_call_id`.

Keep an explicit dispatch map of permitted Python functions and validate their
arguments. Never `eval` model output or dispatch arbitrary function/MCP names.
For robot functions, call native MCP through `ctx`, examine feedback and stop at
an ambiguous motion failure. Multiple proposed calls do not authorize
concurrent robot actions; execute them in the order your controller requires.

## History, images and limits

Requests are stateless: maintain `messages` in Python and send the needed history
each time. Append `result["message"]` intact, particularly `reasoning_details`
(Gemini thought signatures). Do not regenerate, trim or reorder those fields
within a tool round trip. Plain text history uses `role` and string `content`.
Assistant function requests can have null/omitted content. Tool results require
string content, usually compact JSON; attach new images in user image messages.

Images accept the MCP block `{type:"image", mimeType:"image/png", data:base64}`
or OpenRouter-style `{type:"image_url", image_url:{url:"data:image/png;base64,..."}}`.
JPEG uses `image/jpeg`. Both forms undergo identical byte/image validation;
`image_url` does not permit HTTP(S), file paths or remote fetching. Encode local
or in-memory images with Python; use the skill's example. Camera observation
image blocks can be passed directly. No observation IDs are needed.

Limits: 32 content blocks per message; 8 images/request; 4 MiB/image, 8 MiB combined;
at most 4096×4096 pixels per image; PNG/JPEG, no animation. Combined non-image
text, schemas, tool arguments/results and reasoning history: 256 KiB. Entire
request: 12 MiB. Preserve only relevant completed turns to keep within limits.

## Known to work

JSON mode, JSON Schema, required/named/auto tool selection, a tool-result follow-up
with JSON Schema, two function calls in one response, and image-to-schema output all
work through this tool. That covers request and response format, not robot-task
reasoning or perception accuracy. This reference covers the supported API subset,
examples and limits; no external documentation is needed.
